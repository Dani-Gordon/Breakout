## The Brief & Rules of Discoball Engagement

The idea of Breakout is to move your bar along the bottom of the screen with your Right and Left Arrow Keys so the ball hits the bar and bounces back up, hitting the brick in it's path. Each brick, depending on the color, is worth points. The max amount of points a player could score (by hitting all of the bricks on the screen) is 238.

Yellow Bricks = 1pt
Green Bricks = 3 pts
Purple Bricks = 5 pts
